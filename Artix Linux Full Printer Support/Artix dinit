NOTE: to get a better experience I recommend adding the Arch repos in order to get a package, that is missing in the Artix repos
  1. Install the "artix-archlinux-support" package
  2. Edit the "/etc/pacman.conf" file and add the arch repo at the bottom like this:
      [extra]
      Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist-arch
  3. Populate the archlinux keyring
	 sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
  4. Resynchronise your package database with
      sudo pacman -Sy
  5. Add the "ipp-usb" packages to the long list of packages to install

## First install the necessary packages
	sudo pacman -S --needed cups-dinit cups-filters cups-pdf ghostscript gsfonts gutenprint foomatic-db foomatic-db-ppds system-config-printer avahi-dinit nss-mdns smbclient sane-dinit hplip

## Enable the CUPS Service
  sudo dinitctl enable cupsd
  sudo dinitctl start cupsd
  ## to check wether the CUPS Service is running, use this command:
      sudo dinitctl status cupsd
  ## you should get something like this:
      Service: cupsd
        State: STARTED
        Activation: explicitly started
        Process ID: 475

## Enable the Avahi Daemon
  sudo dinitctl enable avahi-daemon
  sudo dinitctl start avahi-daemon
  ## to check wether the Avahi Daemon is running, use this command:
      sudo dinitctl status avahi-daemon
  ## you should get something like this:
      Service: avahi-daemon
        State: STARTED
        Activation: explicitly started
        Process ID: 11435

## Enable the saned service
  sudo dinitctl enable saned

## Enable the ipp-usb service (if added from the arch repo)
  NOTE: since we installed "ipp-usb" from the arch repo, it does not automatically create a service file in our /etc/dinit.d directory. Therefore we will have to create the file manually
    ## Create a service file (replace vim with your editor of choice)
      sudo vim /etc/dinit.d/ipp-usb
        type		= process
        command		= /usr/bin/ipp-usb -f
        smooth-recovery	= true
        depends-on	= dbus
        depends-on	= avahi-daemon
        depends-on 	= local.target
        before		= login.target
      ## Now we make the file executable
        sudo chmod +x /etc/dinit.d/ipp-usb
      ## Now we can finally start the service with
        sudo dinitctl enable ipp-usb
        sudo dinitctl start ipp-usb

## Open the config and change „hosts“ using your favourite Text Editor (vim, nano,...)
	sudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  hosts: files mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mymachines

## restart the avahi-daemon
  sudo dinitctl restart avahi-daemon

## Configure your firewall to allow following ports (in this case ufw/gufw) You may need to the command to your Firewall Service
  sudo ufw allow 631/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 5353/udp

## Add yourself to the scanner and lp (printer) Group
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" scanner
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" lp
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" lpadmin NOTE: the person in this group has 100% modifying right for printers. If the person is you/the owner of the PC this is fine. If you're adding
                                        a family user, coworker,... someone who should not have administrative rights, simply don't add them to the lpadmin group

## Log out and back in

## Add your printer via the installed package "system-config-printer"
