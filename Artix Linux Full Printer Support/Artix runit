NOTE: to get a better experience I recommend adding the Arch repos in order to get a package, that is missing in the Artix repos
  1. Install the "artix-archlinux-support" package
  2. Edit the "/etc/pacman.conf" file and add the arch repo at the bottom like this:
      [extra]
      Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist-arch
  3. Populate the archlinux keyring
	 sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
  4. Resynchronise your package database with
      sudo pacman -Sy
  5. Add the "ipp-usb" packages to the long list of packages to install

## First install the necessary packages
	sudo pacman -S --needed cups cups-filters cups-pdf ghostscript gsfonts gutenprint foomatic-db foomatic-db-ppds system-config-printer avahi nss-mdns smbclient sane sane-runit hplip

## Enable the CUPS Service
  sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/cupsd /run/runit/service
  sudo sv up cupsd
  ## to check wether the CUPS Service is running, use this command:
     sudo sv status cupsd
  ## you should get something like this:
      run: cupsd: (pid 925) 26s

## Enable the AVAHI service
  sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/avahi-daemon /run/runit/service
  sudo sv up avahi-daemon
    ## to check wether the avahi-daemon is running, use this command:
      sudo sv status avahi-daemon
    ## you should get something like this:
      run: avahi-daemon: (pid 9879) 17s

## Enable the saned service
	sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/saned /run/runit/service
	sudo sv up saned
		## to check wether saned is running, use this command:
      		sudo sv status saned
    	## you should get something like this:
     		run: saned: (pid 6711) 11s

## Enable the ipp-usb service (if added from the arch repo)
  NOTE: since we installed "ipp-usb" from the arch repo, it does not automatically create a service file in our /etc/runit/sv/ directory. Therefore we will have to create the file manually
    ## First create a service directory
      sudo mkdir -v /etc/runit/sv/ipp-usb
    ## Now we create the run file (replace vim with your editor of choice) and edit it
      sudo vim /etc/runit/sv/ipp-usb/run
        #!/bin/sh
        exec ipp-usb
    ## Now we make the file executable
      sudo chmod +x /etc/runit/sv/ipp-usb/run
    ## Now we can finally start the service with
      sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/ipp-usb /run/runit/service
      sudo sv up ipp-usb
        ## to check wether the avahi-daemon is running, use this command:
          sudo sv status ipp-usb
        ## you should get something like this
          run: ipp-usb: (pid 3953) 10s

## Open the config and change „hosts“ using your favourite Text Editor (vim, nano,...)
	sudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  hosts: files mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns mymachines

## restart the avahi-daemon
  sudo sv restart avahi-daemon

## Configure your firewall to allow following ports (in this case ufw/gufw) You may need to the command to your Firewall Service
  sudo ufw allow 631/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 5353/udp

## Add yourself to the scanner and lp (printer) Group
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" scanner
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" lp
  sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" lpadmin NOTE: the person in this group has 100% modifying right for printers. If the person is you/the owner of the PC this is fine. If you're adding
                                        a family user, coworker,... someone who should not have administrative rights, simply don't add them to the lpadmin group
	## In case one or more of the groups are missing (e.g. lpadmin), simply create these groups and add yourself to them
		sudo groupadd lpadmin

## Log out and back in

## Add your printer via the installed package "system-config-printer"
