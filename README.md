# Linux-full-printer-support
This is the way of installing full Printer and Scanner support on various Linux distros, such as Arch, Debian and Fedora

Typing/Pasting in these commands should give you full printer and scanner support on Arch Linux, Debian and Fedora. The same applies for their derivatives aslong as the
packages are available in their package manager

This is without a guarantee, I created the list mainly for myself and on Arch I had no problem with it
